# STAT 547m/Assignment 8 (Ray Wu)

This repository contains the files for the assignment. Here are the features I added: 
* Sorting Data by Price
* Plotting Price instead of Alcohol Content
* Adding a banner picture
* Allowing searching among all countries
* Changing the number of bins to be equal to the price range (one bin per price)
